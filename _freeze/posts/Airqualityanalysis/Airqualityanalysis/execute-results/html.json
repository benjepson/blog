Airthings has a great phone app (bluetooth) and excellent web dashboards. For this project, I'll be downloading the logs and working with them in R. They have an API if you want to get real time data, maybe I'll test that out in the future, but for now we'll work with a fixed dataset.\n\nRadon is important to me, I live in an area where it can be a problem. Temperature isn't too critical but since it's logged anyways we'll look at it, might also be an important predictor for other measurements. Humidity in the basement is important to know, I need to make sure it doesn't get above 60% RH, at least not for long. We don't want to have mold issues. I don't know that it's necessary to measure humidity, I believe I can feel when it's too high, but since we are logging it will be nice information to have, to confirm my sensory experience. Pressure might be used as a predictor for forecasting. VOC is important to look at, I want to have healthy air. $CO_2$ is (to me) a proxy for \"freshness\", I doubt it will be at a harmful level, but elevated levels might indicate a need for ventilation.\n\nI assume through this project that the Wave Plus is accurate for each measurement. I don't have secondary measurements for any of these to verify against. For what it's worth I did have an inexpensive temperature/humidity meter running at the same time for the first couple of months, but the battery ran out and I haven't replaced it. The readings seemed very similar to the Wave Plus but I have no recordings of them.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### read in dataset\nwave_data <- read_delim(\"airthings_export_110623.csv\", \n                          delim = \";\", \n                          escape_double = FALSE, \n                          col_types = cols(recorded = col_character()), \n                          trim_ws = TRUE)\n\nwave_data <- wave_data %>% \n    mutate(recorded = as_datetime(gsub(pattern = \"T\", \n                              replacement = \" \", \n                              x = wave_data$recorded))\n    ) %>% \n    rename(radon_pci_L = `RADON_SHORT_TERM_AVG pCi/L`, \n           temp_F      = `TEMP Â°F`, \n           humidity    = `HUMIDITY %`, \n           pressure    = `PRESSURE mBar`, \n           CO2         = `CO2 ppm`, \n           VOC         = `VOC ppb`)\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](profile.jpg)\n",
